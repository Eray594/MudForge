## **Usage**

### **1. Theming Setup**
Add the following lines to `Program.cs` to configure MudForge's theming services:

```csharp
using MudForge.Theming;

var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);

// Add MudForge Theming Service
builder.Services.AddThemeServices(new ThemeServiceConfiguration
{
    IsDarkMode = true, // Default theme set to Dark Mode
    LocalStorageKey = "theme_mode", // Stores user preference
    Theme = new MudTheme() // Provide MudBlazor theme configuration
});

await builder.Build().RunAsync();
```

---

### **2. Add Components**
Add the following components to `App.razor` or `MainLayout.razor`:

```razor
@inject MudThemeService ThemeService

<MudThemeProvider Theme="ThemeService.Theme" @bind-IsDarkMode="ThemeService.IsDarkMode"/>
<MudDialogProvider/>
<MudSnackbarProvider/>

@code {
    protected override void OnInitialized()
        => ThemeService.OnThemeChanged += StateHasChanged;
}
```

> **Note:** It does not matter whether the MudBlazor components are placed in `App.razor` or `MainLayout.razor`, as long as the service specifies the configuration.

---

### **3. Toggle Between Light and Dark Mode**
With the `ToggleAsync` method in **MudThemeService**, you can easily switch between **Light and Dark Mode**:

```razor
@inject MudThemeService ThemeService
<MudButton OnClick="ThemeService.ToggleAsync">Toggle Theme</MudButton>
```

---

## **Conclusion**
MudForge provides a simple yet powerful way to implement theming in Blazor applications using MudBlazor. The library is flexible, customizable, and integrates seamlessly into existing Blazor projects.
